Rather than a makefile I've built two shell scripts.

#########
clean.sh:
#########

This is to clean up your repo and remove all executables and -o files. Make sure NOT to commit any object or executable files to the git repo. Really bad practice and causes a lot of headaches.

run using
$ ./clean.sh

if you can't execute the file run
$ chmod +x ./clean.sh

#########
make.sh
#########

use the same way as clean.sh to create the executables
