How to use git for the purpose of this project. 

To clone git repo:

run:
$ git clone https://github.com/jssands/PLTgame.git

You are already a contributor, so you should be able to pull/push without issue.

add files to a commit if you have made changes to them:

$ git add file1.txt file2.txt

$ git commit -m "here's what these changes are for..."

$ git push

Make sure to run

$ git pull

before you start working on the code any given day because otherwise you may accidently work on an old version of the code and run into merge issues. If you get a merge issue, best not to push cause it could compromise the code on the repo.
